# Data_Analysis

The python script provided contains two parts.  The first part is called "Learning about Python" and is the code I wrote while learning Python to strengthen my skills.  The second part is called "CognitiveClass (Data Analysis w/ Python)" and is the code I wrote while taking an IBM initiave online course named CognitiveClass.ai. Within this file, both analyzation and visualization can be seen.
