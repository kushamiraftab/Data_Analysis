# Data_Analysis

There are two non-readme files found in Data_Analysis.  The first is Data.csv which is the data set used in the first part of the DataAnalysis.ipynb file.  The second is Data Analysis.ipynb which is the actual python script file, which contains two parts.  The first part is called "Learning about Python" and is the code I wrote while learning Python to strengthen my skills.  The second part is called "CognitiveClass (Data Analysis w/ Python)" and is the code I wrote while taking an IBM initiave online course named CognitiveClass.ai. In the second part, the data set used can be found at "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data". Within this file, both analyzation and visualization can be seen.
